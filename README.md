# USED (Urdu Stemmer Evaluation Dataset) 

## Overview

This repository contains the **USED** dataset, which was used in our research to design and evaluate the Urdu stemmer. This is an improved version of the dataset initially utilized in our earlier research work, Jabbar et al., 2018 and Jabbar et al., 2019. The word corpus has been carefully processed, which includes the elimination of Urdu diacritics, as well as the removal of stop words, punctuation, numbers, and symbols. Additionally, English and French characters have been deleted. The resulting corpus comprises 56,074 Urdu words, featuring uni-grams, bi-grams, tri-grams, compound words, broken plural forms, and words containing infixes.\
\
We have dedicated considerable time and effort to its development and refinement. However, as with any dataset created by humans, there may still be some inaccuracies.\
\
We are pleased to make this dataset available to the research community for free, encouraging its use in related studies. We kindly request that you reference the following paper if you decide to utilize this dataset in your scholarly work,
